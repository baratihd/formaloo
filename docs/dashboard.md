# Dashboard Design
## Data Transfer
  - **Method:** The Appstore service can communicate data to the Dashboard service using REST API calls
                for real-time updates. For higher scalability and asynchronous processing, a message queue
                (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka) could be used.
  - **Reason:** REST APIs are simple to implement and sufficient for low-to-moderate traffic, while message
                queues provide better decoupling and scalability when handling a high volume of events.
## Data Aggregation
  - **Approach:** The Dashboard service will aggregate data from the Appstore. Data can be stored in a dedicated
                  analytics database.
  - **Technology:** A time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) or a columnar database (e.g., ClickHouse) would be
                    suitable for statistical analysis and handling large volumes of time-stamped data.
## Scalability
  - **Strategy:**
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Both the Appstore and Dashboard services should support horizontal scaling via
                              load balancing.
    - **Database Replication**: Use database replication and sharding to distribute load.
    - **Caching**: Implement caching (e.g., using Redis) to reduce database load for frequently accessed statistics.
    - **Asynchronous Processing**: For heavy data aggregation tasks, consider using asynchronous task queues
                                   (e.g., Celery with RabbitMQ or Redis).
